## ✨ Behind the Scenes

We prepared these slides to showcase the journey of our research—from data cleaning and uncovering the **31.10% Rent concentration**, to analyzing the **low 0.01 CapEx ratio**, and finally highlighting the three essential actions required for immediate cost correction.

The big day will be our chance to present all our work, share actionable insights, and celebrate transforming raw numbers into a clear, engaging story about financial stability and efficiency.
