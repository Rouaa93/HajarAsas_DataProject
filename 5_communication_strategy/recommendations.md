# HAJARASAS BLOCK FACTORY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS REPORT

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Date:** December 2025
**Prepared By:** Data Analyst Team

The comprehensive analysis of HajarAsas's initial financial data reveals high operational efficiency risks due to severe cost concentration. The primary finding is that the **Rent category consumes 31.10% of the total Operational Expenditure (Opex)**, making it the highest priority for cost reduction. Furthermore, the **Capital Expenditure (CapEx) to Opex ratio stands critically low at 0.01**, suggesting an imbalance and highlighting issues with asset valuation and data completeness. Immediate executive action is required to address lease costs and ensure accurate CapEx reporting.

## 2. KEY FINDINGS AND DATA VISUALIZATION

### 2.1. Opex Concentration and Cost Priority

The distribution of Opex is highly concentrated among the top three categories, indicating where the vast majority of resources are being spent:

| Category | Contribution to Total Opex |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Rent** | 31.10% |
| **Name/Person** | 26.99% |
| **Equipment** | 25.55% |

[**INSERT BAR CHART IMAGE HERE:** 'opex_by_category_bar_chart.png']
*Finding:* The top three categories account for approximately 83.64% of total operational costs.

### 2.2. CapEx vs. Opex Investment Breakdown

The comparison of long-term investment (CapEx) against short-term operational costs (Opex) is crucial for a new project:

* **Total Opex:** $6,205,352.00
* **Total CapEx:** $60,568.80
* **CapEx/Opex Ratio:** **0.01** (or 0.97% of total spending)

[**INSERT PIE CHART IMAGE HERE:** 'capex_opex_pie_chart.png']
*Finding:* The project is overwhelmingly dominated by operational spending, raising questions about whether major asset acquisitions (machinery, vehicles) have been fully recorded or priced.

### 2.3. Monthly Spending Trend Analysis

The time-series analysis shows distinct phases in the project's financial outlay:

| Month | Total Opex |
| :--- | :--- |
| **7.0 (Peak)** | $3,040,394.00 |
| **8.0 (Stabilization)** | $709,734.00 |

[**INSERT LINE PLOT IMAGE HERE:** 'monthly_opex_line_plot.png']
*Finding:* The sharp decline after Month 7 indicates the costly setup phase is complete, and the business is transitioning into a stable, lower-cost operating rhythm.

## 3. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS (ACTION PLAN)

Based on the quantitative analysis, the following three actions are prioritized for management review:

### 3.1. High-Priority Cost Reduction: Renegotiate Lease Agreement

* **Rationale:** Rent is the single largest controllable expense (31.10%). Even a small percentage saving here yields significant returns.
* **Action:** Immediately task the financial and procurement teams to **re-evaluate or renegotiate the current lease contract**. Explore feasibility of a different payment structure or a more cost-effective location/property.

### 3.2. Data Integrity and Asset Valuation

* **Rationale:** The dangerously low CapEx/Opex ratio (0.01) and known existence of null values in the Capital file indicate that the total investment value is currently underrepresented.
* **Action:** Assign dedicated personnel to **input prices for the [Insert Number of Missing Assets Here] assets with missing values** in the Capital file. Accurate CapEx is essential for depreciation and financial reporting.

### 3.3. Financial Planning: Realistic Budgeting

* **Rationale:** Budgeting based on the high-spending setup months (Month 6 & 7) will inflate future forecasts unrealistically.
* **Action:** Adopt the **average spending from the stabilization period (Month 8 onwards)** as the official baseline for future operational budgets and cash flow projections.
