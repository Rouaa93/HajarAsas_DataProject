# 📁 1. DataSets: Source and Processed Data

This directory serves as the centralized repository for all financial records used in the HajarAsas Financial Analysis Project.

---

## 🔒 Data Source and Provenance

The data is **proprietary (Project-specific)** and was generated internally through the project's daily operational process.

* **Source:** Daily manual entry and logging of all Capital and Operational expenditures by the project owners (The [Your Names/Team] Project Founders) onto local spreadsheets.
* **Authenticity:** The raw files represent the direct, unadjusted log of every transaction and asset acquisition.

## 💾 Directory Structure

The directory is split into two primary subfolders to maintain data integrity and separation:

| Subfolder | Purpose | State |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`raw`** | Contains the original, unaltered files resulting from the daily internal logging process. **These files are kept completely unchanged.** | **UNTOUCHED** |
| **`processed`** | Contains the output files generated by the `2_data_preparation` scripts. These are the clean, unified, and ready-to-analyze datasets. | **CLEAN / FINAL** |

## 📊 Data Files Overview

The analysis is based on two core financial registers:

### A. Operating Expenses (`operating-expenses_cleaned_final.csv`)

| Field | Description | Dtype (Cleaned) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Date** | Date of the transaction. | Datetime | No Missing Values |
| **Category** | Unified expense category (e.g., Rent, Labor). | String | Unified |
| **Price / Amount** | The financial value of the expense. | Float64 | No Missing Values |

### B. Capital Assets (`capital_cleaned_final_V2.csv`)

| Field | Description | Dtype (Cleaned) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Item Arabic** | Original Arabic name of the asset (e.g., Machine). | String | No Missing Values |
| **Price** | The recorded cost of the capital asset. | Float64 | **NOTE: Contains Missing Values (requires management input)** |
| **Category** | Unified asset category (e.g., Machinery, Construction). | String | Unified |

## ⚠️ Integrity and Privacy Note

The raw files are highly sensitive project data. The `raw` folder is explicitly **excluded from the final GitHub repository** (via `.gitignore`) to manage repository size and maintain data security.
